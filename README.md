If you're interested in learning about deploying scalable and secure web applications using REST API, our learning platform is perfect for you! We use Django API, which enables users to create polls and view results. Our platform also provides guidance on which programming language to choose among C++, Java, and Python!

Django Polls is a user-friendly web application that allows users to create and participate in polls. Once a poll is created, users can vote on the available options, view the results in real-time, and share the poll with their friends.

Built using the Django framework, the application is scalable, secure, and easy to customize. It provides a great starting point for beginners who are looking to learn Django, as well as for experienced developers who want to build their own custom polling application.

The application features a user authentication system, a responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices, and an easy-to-use admin panel that allows administrators to manage polls, add new questions, and view results.

Whether you're a student looking to build a project for your coursework or an entrepreneur looking to create a polling platform for your business, Django Polls provides a solid foundation for building your own custom polling application.
